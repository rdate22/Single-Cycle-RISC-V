# Single-Cycle-RISC-V
A pipelined Single Cycle Risc-V processor
Project Description
This project involves the design and implementation of a 32-bit RISC-V CPU using System Verilog, starting with a Single-Cycle CPU and advancing to a multi-cycle/pipelined version for enhanced performance. 
The goal is to create a CPU that supports basic arithmetic operations, load/store instructions, and branching, while achieving faster execution through pipelining.

Setup and Installation
Development Tools:

Quartus Prime: For FPGA development and synthesis.
ModelSim: For simulation and testing of the CPU design.
Verilator: For Verilog simulation if needed.
Environment Setup:

Install Quartus Prime and ModelSim.
Clone this repository and open the project in Quartus Prime.
Set up ModelSim for simulation and testing.
For hardware implementation, configure the development environment based on the FPGA hardware being used.
Single-Cycle RISC-V CPU Design
Features
Instruction Set: Implements rv32i specifications, including ADD, ADDI, SB, LB, J, and BEQ instructions.
Modules:
Instruction Memory: Stores the binary instructions.
Data Memory: Handles load and store operations.
Registers: General-purpose registers for storing intermediate values.
ALU: Performs arithmetic and logic operations.
Control Unit: Decodes instructions and generates control signals.
Branching Logic: Handles conditional and unconditional branches.
Testing
Simulate the Single-Cycle CPU using ModelSim.
Test with a variety of assembly programs to ensure all supported instructions execute correctly.
Verify the functionality of the CPU using waveforms generated by ModelSim.
Multi-Cycle/Pipelined RISC-V CPU Design
Features
Enhanced Performance: Faster execution due to pipelining.
Same Instruction Set: Retains the rv32i instruction set from the Single-Cycle CPU.
Pipelining Stages:
Instruction Fetch (IF): Fetches instructions from memory.
Instruction Decode (ID): Decodes fetched instructions and reads registers.
Execution (EX): Performs arithmetic and logic operations.
Memory Access (MEM): Accesses data memory for load and store instructions.
Write Back (WB): Writes results back to registers.
Hazard Handling
Data Hazards: Managed using forwarding and stalling techniques.
Control Hazards: Handled by implementing techniques such as branch prediction or delayed branching.
Testing
Simulate the Multi-Cycle/Pipelined CPU using ModelSim.
Test with comprehensive assembly programs to ensure correct pipelined execution.
Verify pipelined CPU performance improvements over the Single-Cycle CPU.
